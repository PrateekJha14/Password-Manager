# Password Management Application

## Project Overview
This Password Management Application is designed to securely store, organize, and generate strong passwords for users across multiple devices. The application ensures top-level security with encryption, multi-factor authentication, and secure synchronization of data. Users can categorize passwords, perform strength audits, and receive alerts if credentials are found in data breaches. With both offline access and cross-platform functionality, the app allows users to securely retrieve their passwords anytime.

## Key Features
- **Secure Storage**: Uses encryption algorithms to securely store passwords locally or in the cloud.
- **Cross-Platform Functionality**: Ensures consistent performance on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Password Generation**: Provides a customizable, strong password generator with options for length and character types.
- **Password Categorization**: Allows users to organize passwords into folders (e.g., banking, social, work).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Offers options like fingerprint or facial recognition for enhanced security.
- **Password Recovery**: Enables secure recovery using email verification, recovery codes, or backup keys.
- **Password Strength Audits**: Notifies users of weak, reused, or compromised passwords with update suggestions.
- **Data Breach Alerts**: Integrates data breach monitoring to alert users if their credentials are found in compromised databases.
- **Offline Access**: Allows users to access passwords offline in an encrypted format.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Synchronizes data across devices with end-to-end encryption for secure access.

## Learning Resources
